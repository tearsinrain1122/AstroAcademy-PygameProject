# Astro Academy
## Purpose 
This is a children's educational space game built using pygame, that I made alongside a team of six other developers for a coursework project (the original repository with the collaborators and commit history had links to the educational organisation, who requested that we create a new public version).  

The primary aim of this project was to create an educational game that engages children and challenge their reflexes while encouraging them to learn more about space, ultimately sparking an early interest in STEM subjects. As a team, we all have a shared passion for changing the gender gap in the technology industry, as well as a common interest in science. We therefore hope the game will inspire young girls in particular to believe that a career in the aerospace industry or any other scientific field is possible; factual content in the game was chosen with this aim in mind, championing the achievements of women in the field. 

## Game Logic
The premise of the game centres on an astronaut required to dodge asteroids in order to navigate (or ‘fly’) through space successfully; 1 of 3 lives is lost each time a collision occurs, and the game ends when lives reach 0. The player’s multi-tasking ability is also challenged by the display of space-related facts. High scores are recorded and displayed.  

## My role
My tasks included:
- Researching pygame and in particular OOP designs for simple games
